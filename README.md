# 👋 Hi there, I'm Roman

I'm a full-time **ColdFusion developer** who takes care of pretty much everything – from frontend to backend and everything in between.  
Whether it's building features, fixing bugs, or connecting systems, I enjoy making things work and keeping them clean and simple.

- 🛠️ Full-stack-ish: whatever needs doing, I’ll get it done  
- 🧩 I like well-structured code and practical solutions  
- ☕ Most productive with good coffee and clear specs
